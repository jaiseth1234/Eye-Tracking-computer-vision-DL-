Eye Tracking with Computer Vision and Deep learning
 
# Project overview
This project is an eye-tracking system built using Python, OpenCV, and deep learning models. The goal of the project is to create a basic computer vision application that can track the user's eyes using a webcam and potentially trigger actions based on where the user is looking. This could have applications in hands-free navigation, app launching, or accessibility tools and more.

# Features:

1. Real-time video: It captures video from a webcam in real-time using OpenCV.
2. Face and Eye Detection: The system uses pre-trained models to detect the face and eyes in each video frame.
3. Pupil Detection: The project can identify the user’s pupils and identify where the user is looking.
4. Gaze Estimation (Planned Feature): It involves mapping the user’s eye gaze to specific coordinates on the screen, allowing for interaction without touch.

# Tech Used:

1. Programming Language: Python
2. Computer vision: OpenCV
3. Deep Learning: TensorFlow and Pytorch (Gaze Estimation)
4. Data: Haar Cascade models for face and eye detection
